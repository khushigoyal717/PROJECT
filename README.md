Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using the demo_transactions dataset. The analysis was carried out entirely in Google Colab with Python, making use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning models, and visualizations to generate insights.

The aim is to help businesses identify high-value customers, optimize marketing strategies, and improve decision-making.

âš™ Tools & Technologies Used

Google Colab (Development Environment)

Python (Programming Language)

Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Model Building & Evaluation)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Name: demo_transactions.csv

Description: Contains transactional details such as customer ID, transaction amount, frequency, and recency.

ðŸš€ Workflow

Data Loading & Cleaning â€“ Imported dataset into Google Colab, handled missing values, and formatted columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualized customer purchase frequency, transaction amounts, and distribution of values.

Feature Engineering â€“ Extracted customer-level features like frequency, recency, and monetary value.

Model Building â€“ Applied supervised machine learning models (Regression models) to predict CLV.

Evaluation â€“ Measured model accuracy using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² Score.

Prediction & Output â€“ Generated a CSV file with predicted LTV values for each customer.                                                                                                                                 Conclusion

The project successfully built a predictive model for estimating Customer Lifetime Value. Using the transaction dataset, we gained actionable insights that can guide business strategies for customer retention and profitability.
